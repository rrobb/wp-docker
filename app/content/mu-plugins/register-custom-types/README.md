# Register Custom Post Types

## Usage
This plugin handles registration of custom PostTypes and Taxonomies. All custom PostTypes and Taxonomies available in 
the `project/postTypes` and `project/taxonomies` will be registered automatically.
The plugin provides a WP-Admin page *Manage Taxonomy-PostType relations* under `Settings -> Manage relations` in 
the admin menu bar. 

## Installation
As a mu-plugin, the plugin is installed by default. 
Any custom PostTypes or Taxonomies should be installed in the `project/customTypes` directory.
